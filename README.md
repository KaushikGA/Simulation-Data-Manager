# Simulation Data Manager (Hybrid C# / Python)

## Overview
A robust automation architecture designed to orchestrate scientific workflows. This application bridges the gap between **High-Performance Computing (Python/Solver)** and **Enterprise Data Management (C#/.NET/SQL)**.

It was originally developed to manage the massive datasets generated by my **[Composite Pressure Vessel Optimization](https://github.com/KaushikGA/Composite-Pressure-Vessel-Optimization)** framework. The genetic optimization algorithms, when used with Abaqus/Ansys solvers tend to create massive amounts of data. This manager architecture is able to parse the result files and store them in SQL database.

## System Architecture
The system uses a **Controller-Worker** pattern:
1.  **C# (The Manager):** Handles file I/O, database transactions, and process orchestration.
2.  **Python (The Worker):** Embedded as a resource, extracted at runtime to parse complex unstructured FEA logs (`GEN_*.log`).
3.  **SQLite (The Storage):** Ensures ACID-compliant data storage for concurrent simulation runs.
